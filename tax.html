        <div class="tax-info-container">
            <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Car Payment</h2>
                <p>A car payment is a regular payment made towards the financing or leasing of a vehicle. It typically consists of principal and interest.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> John makes a monthly car payment of $300 to pay off his auto loan.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Downpayment</h2>
                <p>A initial payment made upfront when purchasing an item or securing a loan, often expressed as a percentage of the total purchase price.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Emily is purchasing a house for $200,000. She made a downpayment of 20%, which amounts to $40,000. This reduces her mortgage loan amount to $160,000.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Finance or Leasing</h2>
                <p>Options for obtaining a vehicle, either through financing (taking out a loan to purchase) or leasing (renting for a specified period).</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah decided to lease a car for three years instead of buying it outright.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Payoff Schedule</h2>
                <p>A plan outlining the timeline and amounts for repaying a loan or debt in full, including interest and principal payments.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Jessica has a student loan with a principal amount of $20,000 and an interest rate of 5%. She plans to pay off the loan in five years. Her payoff schedule indicates that she needs to make monthly payments of $377.42. The schedule also shows how each payment is allocated between principal and interest, with the majority going towards interest at the beginning of the repayment period.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>House Payment</h2>
                <p>The monthly payment made towards a mortgage, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Alex purchased a house for $250,000 with a 20% downpayment. He secured a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with an interest rate of 4%. His monthly house payment includes the principal and interest on the loan, property taxes, and homeowners insurance. After calculating, Alex's total monthly house payment is $1,523.91.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Mortgage Rate</h2>
                <p>The interest rate charged on a mortgage loan, determining the cost of borrowing for purchasing a home.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Emily applied for a mortgage to buy a home. Her mortgage lender offered her a 30-year fixed-rate loan with an interest rate of 4%. This means that Emily will pay an annual interest rate of 4% on her mortgage loan. It's important to note that mortgage rates can vary based on factors such as the borrower's credit score, loan term, and prevailing market conditions.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Down Payment</h2>
                <p>Initial payments made when purchasing a property or securing a loan, typically representing a percentage of the total purchase price.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah is buying a house for $300,000. Her mortgage lender requires a down payment of 20%. This means Sarah needs to pay $60,000 upfront as a down payment to secure the loan. The down payment reduces the amount of the mortgage loan she needs to borrow, which can affect her monthly payments and overall loan terms.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Budget Setup</h2>
                <p>Creating a plan for managing income and expenses to achieve financial goals, often involving categorizing expenses and setting spending limits.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Mark wants to take control of his finances, so he decides to set up a budget. He starts by listing all his sources of income and then categorizes his expenses into groups such as housing, transportation, groceries, utilities, entertainment, and savings. After analyzing his spending habits, Mark sets spending limits for each category and allocates a portion of his income towards savings and investments. By following his budget, Mark is able to better manage his money and work towards achieving his financial goals.</p>

                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Interest Rates</h2>
                <p>The cost of borrowing money, expressed as a percentage, charged by lenders on loans or earned by investors on savings.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Emily opened a savings account with a bank. The bank offered an annual interest rate of 2% on her savings balance. This means that for every $1000 Emily saves in her account, she earns $20 in interest per year. On the other hand, if Emily takes out a loan with an interest rate of 6%, she will have to pay $60 in interest annually for every $1000 borrowed. Interest rates can vary depending on the type of loan, prevailing market conditions, and the borrower's creditworthiness.</p>

                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Taxes</h2>
                <p>Mandatory financial contributions imposed by governments on individuals and businesses to fund public services and infrastructure.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong>  Sarah works as an employee in a company. A portion of her salary is withheld by her employer to pay income taxes to the government. Additionally, Sarah pays sales tax when she purchases goods at a store. The government uses tax revenues to fund public services such as education, healthcare, transportation, and defense. Taxes can be levied at the federal, state, and local levels and can vary based on factors such as income, property ownership, and consumption.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Savings Account Breakdown</h2>
                <p>Analysis of the components of a savings account, including deposits, withdrawals, interest earned, and fees charged.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> John has a savings account with a bank. Over the course of a year, he made several deposits totaling $10,000 and made no withdrawals. At the end of the year, John's account balance grew to $10,500, including $500 in interest earned. However, the bank charged a $25 maintenance fee for the account. Therefore, John's net gain in his savings account for the year was $475. This breakdown helps John understand how his savings account grows over time and the impact of fees on his savings.</p>
            </div>
                      <div class="tax-info-box">
                <h2>Student Loan Payoff Schedule</h2>
                <p>A plan for repaying student loans, outlining the timeline and amounts of payments required to eliminate the debt.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong>  Sarah took out a student loan to pay for her college education. Her loan has a principal amount of $30,000 and an interest rate of 6%. She opted for a 10-year repayment plan. Using a loan amortization calculator, Sarah determined that her monthly payment would be approximately $333.20. The payoff schedule shows how much of each payment goes towards interest and principal, and over the 10-year period, Sarah will pay a total of $39,984, including $9,984 in interest. Following the payoff schedule helps Sarah stay on track with her student loan payments and manage her finances effectively.</p>
